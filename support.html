                <p>This page serves to describe why I think you should support crowd-funding
                in general, my work in particular and how you can do so. I do share my long-term goals in order
                to provide some context, but this is <strong>not</strong> a goal-based fundraising campaign.

                <p>Years ago I came up with an idea I call <em>distributed micro-income</em>. With the launch of this
                page I am embarking
                on that Grand Experiment. My long-term goal is to establish a diverse collection of income
                streams that, in aggregate, provide enough cash flow to live on. This page represents <strong>one</strong>
                aspect of that overall plan: Leveraging crowd-funding
                to work for the benefit of all.

                <p>It may not have reached the public consciousness yet, but those in the tech industry see that we've
                entered a new age; the <em>Creative</em> Revolution is in full swing. The corporate structure and
                capabilities born of the previous <em>Industrial</em> Revolution are no longer restricted to those
                with the money and social influence to grasp them. The availability of the Internet, DIY culture
                and the advent of crowd-funding have all converged
                to provide unprecedented opportunities for the average person.

                <p>As mentioned above, my goal is to produce goods and services that benefit everyone - not just
                those who can afford to pay and companies. In the same way that people give
                to pay for schools, clean sidewalks,  and all the other things that benefit society
                as a whole, I'm asking you to help support my efforts to:

                <ul>
                    <li>Create, maintain and improve open source software.</li>
                    <li>Write educational tutorials, books and documentation.</li>
                    <li>Make instructional, informative videos.</li>
                    <li>Produce entertaining novels, short stories, videos, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>and so that all of these things can be made available to <em>everyone</em> - free of charge.
                This is not an exhaustive list. Coming up with new ideas is also part of the work I will be doing,
                but this represents a good starting point.

                <p>Let's change the world.

                    <p>I estimate that I need approximately $100k/year overall (from <em>all</em> income sources) to
                       replace what I currently get from traditional employment - including expenses like healthcare
                       insurance, tax payments, etc. This roughly breaks down to around $8k/month or $2k/week. My
                       plan is for <strong>a portion</strong> of this income to come from crowd-funding sources like
                       the ones suggested here.

                    <h3>Offer a bounty</h3>
                    <p>If there is an existing issue you'd like addressed in an open source project there are services
                    that allow you to set a <em>bounty</em> on it: Offer a cash incentive for a developer to provide
                    a solution. Different bounty services work in different ways. I have accounts at the two listed
                    below, but am open to any.

                                &amp; PayPal only for now. Bounties remain until the issue is closed. If the issue is
                                closed as "won't fix" the bounty amount is refunded. Bountysource also supports
                                fundraising.

                        I won't lie to you; this is all going to build slowly - for me as well as you. It's a Catch-22,
                        chicken-and-egg situation: I need to raise enough money to be able to quit my job, so I have
                        time to spend on all the work you're funding me to do. But, of course, you'd like to see some
                        results before you dump a bunch of money into my pocket. That's reasonable.
                    <p>
                        Hopefully my current resume and existing work history, even if established through more
                        traditional means, gives you some feel for my skill and abilities. I'm also working on a few
                        ideas to provide as much transparency as possible and maybe even offer some incentives for
                        higher contribution levels. It's still early stages, but here are some of the ideas I've been
                        thinking about:

                                <strong>Regular, public stand-ups</strong> - in the style of Agile Scrum. A friend
                                suggested IRC, but I'm also considering an audio recording; kind of a mini-podcast.

                                <strong>A donation level that allows voting</strong> on what I will work on. This (and
                                the next idea) would likely be done through Patreon.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>A donation level that can request projects/bugs/features</strong> for me to work
                                on.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        I&apos;m also open to hearing your ideas. While I do expect to also be doing freelance
                        work-for-hire,
                        I&apos;d like to keep these funding efforts in the realm of Open Source so everybody can benefit.
                    <p>
                        And, of course, you're always free to withdraw your support. Both of the patron-based services
                        I've chosen allow you to cancel your recurring payment at any time. I hope that as we travel
                        down this road together I don't give you reason to do so, but I also understand that it's
                        <strong>your</strong> money and you can do whatever you want with it. With any luck we can
                        use it make the world a better place :-)
