      <p>This page serves to describe why I think you should support crowd-funding
        in general, my work in particular and how you can do so. I do share my long-term goals in order
        to provide some context, but this is <strong>not</strong> a goal-based fundraising campaign.

      <p>Years ago I came up with an idea I call <em>distributed micro-income</em>. With the launch of this
        page I am embarking
        on that Grand Experiment. My long-term goal is to establish a diverse collection of income
        streams that, in aggregate, provide enough cash flow to live on. This page represents <strong>one</strong>
        aspect of that overall plan: Leveraging crowd-funding
        to work for the benefit of all.

      <p>It may not have reached the public consciousness yet, but those in the tech industry see that we've
        entered a new age; the <em>Creative</em> Revolution is in full swing. The corporate structure and
        capabilities born of the previous <em>Industrial</em> Revolution are no longer restricted to those
        with the money and social influence to grasp them. The availability of the Internet, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) culture
        and the advent of crowd-funding have all converged
        to provide unprecedented opportunities for the average person.

      <p>As mentioned above, my goal is to produce goods and services that benefit everyone - not just
        companies and those who can afford to pay. In the same way that people give
        to fund education, safe streets, and all the other things that benefit society
        as a whole, I'm asking you to help support my efforts to:

      <ul>
        <li>Create, maintain and improve open source software.</li>
        <li>Write educational tutorials, books and documentation.</li>
        <li>Make instructional, informative videos.</li>
        <li>Produce entertaining novels, short stories, videos, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>and so that all of these things can be made available to <em>everyone</em> - free of charge.
        This is not an exhaustive list. Coming up with new ideas is also part of the work I will be doing,
        but this represents a good starting point.

        <h3>Offer a bounty</h3>

        <p>If there is an existing issue you'd like addressed in an open source project there are services
          that allow you to set a <em>bounty</em> on it: Offer a cash incentive for a developer to provide
          a solution. Different bounty services work in different ways. I have accounts at the two listed
          below. If you know of others, please let me know.

              is a site that allows bounties to be placed and claimed on Github issues. Google Wallet
              &amp; PayPal only for now. Bounties remain until the issue is closed. If the issue is
              closed as "won't fix" the bounty amount is refunded. Bountysource also supports
              fundraising.

              provided within <strong>one week</strong>, or accepted within an additional 48
              hours. <em>Tipping</em>, unrelated to the bounty itself, is also supported.

        <h3>Become a patron</h3>

        <p>
          <em>Patrons</em> provide regular, recurring funding so that I can focus on working on software &amp;
          writing instead of spending that time hunting through job boards, polishing my resume and sitting in
          interviews. At the moment, I have accounts with two crowd-sourcing services that support the
          patron model:

              The plan I've chosen on Patreon

          If you know of other sites and/or services that allow me to create wish- or gift-lists,
          please let me know. I'd especially like to find something that supports listing

          If you'd rather not spend money, but still want to support me there are plenty of other ways
          to help. Here are a few suggestions:

    <div id="expectations">
      <section class="grid-100">
        <h2>
          <a name="expect">What you can expect</a>
        </h2>

        <p class="center">Transparency. Honesty. Integrity.

        <p>I included <a href="#workdone">references to work I've done</a> in the <em><strong>Why
          support Shawn?</strong></em> section above, which provides a good overview of the type and quality of
          work that I do. I also maintain a list of projects I'm <a href="index.html#projects">currently working on</a>
          as well as additional <a href="index.html#ideas">project ideas</a> on the home page of this site. With your
          support I can dedicate more time and resources contributing to these.

        <p>Ultimately, my <strong>long-term</strong> goal is to be able to be able completely fund such work through
          a combination of donations, tips, bounties, commissions, part-time employment, etc. This page is but a
          <strong>small</strong> part of that overall effort. Eventually, I hope to work directly for
          <strong><em>you</em></strong> - all of you - rather than through the middleman of the employment industry.

        <p>I estimate that I will need approximately $100k/year overall (from <em>all</em> income sources) to
          replace what I currently get from traditional employment - including expenses like healthcare
          insurance, tax payments, etc. This roughly breaks down to around $8k/month or $2k/week. My
          plan is for <strong>a portion</strong> of this income to come from crowd-funding sources like
          the ones listed above.

        <p>In the meantime, I will be setting up more ways to communicate what I'm working on and where the money
          is/will be going. Some of the other ideas I'm considering include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Regular, public stand-ups</strong> - in the style of Agile Scrum. A friend
            suggested IRC, but I'm also considering an audio recording; kind of a mini-podcast.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A donation level that allows voting</strong> on what I will work on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A donation level that can request projects/bugs/features</strong> for me to work
            on.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When I need to pay for the services of others I also plan to utilize fellow crowd-funded workers. My
          goal isn't just to free myself from the employment industry, but to support and build these new opportunities
          that we <strong>all</strong> have.
