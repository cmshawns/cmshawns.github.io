                <p>It may not have reached the public consciousness yet, but those in the industry see that we've
                entered a new age; the <em>Creative</em> Revolution is in full swing. The corporate structure and
                capabilities born of the previous <em>Industrial</em> Revolution are no longer restricted to those
                with the money and social influence to grasp them. The availability of the Internet, DIY culture
                and the advent of crowd-funding have all converged
                to provide unprecedented opportunities for the average person.

                <p>Years ago I came up with an idea I call <em>distributed micro-income</em>. Today I am embarking
                on that Grand Experiment. My goal is to establish a diverse collection of income
                streams that together total approximately what I currently make in working at a single, full-time
                job. This page represents <strong>one</strong> aspect of the overall plan: Leveraging crowd-funding
                to work for <strong>you</strong> - all of you. The world at large. In the same way that people give
                to pay for schools, clean sidewalks, feed the hungry and all the other things that benefit society
                as a whole, I'm asking you to help support me so I can:

                <ul>
                    <li>Create, maintain and improve open source software.</li>
                    <li>Write educational tutorials, books and documentation.</li>
                    <li>Make instructional, informative videos.</li>
                    <li>Produce entertaining novels, short stories, videos, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>And so that all of these things can be made available to <em>everyone</em> - free of charge.
                This is not an exhaustive list. I hope to come up with new ideas and discover additional talents,
                but this represents a good starting point.

                <p>I don't expect to be able to do all of this solely with donated funds. I plan to do some
                freelance work-for-hire, commissioned work and maybe even a part-time job. The idea, remember,
                is to have a distributed base of income. <strong>This</strong> page, however, specifically
                the crowd-sourcing aspect of the overall plan. It also represents my first steps down this new
                path as I expect it to take awhile to build to the point where it produces enough income to be
                relevant.

                <p>Hopefully, you will join me.

                    <p>
                        I estimate that I need approximately $100k/year overall (from <em>all</em> income sources) to
                        replace what I currently get from traditional employment - including expenses like healthcare
                        insurance, tax payments, etc. This roughly breaks down to around $8k/month or $2k/week. My
                        plan is for a portion of this income to come from crowd-funding sources like the ones
                        suggested here.

                        patron model:

                    <p>
                        <em>Bounties</em> are rewards or incentives that an individual or organization offers in
                        return for a bug being fixed or feature implemented. Typically, bounties are paid up front with
                        the funds being held by the service (see below) until the bounty is claimed.

                        I won't lie to you; this is all going to build slowly - for me as well as you. It's a Catch-22,
                        chicken-and-egg situation: I need to raise enough money to be able to quit my job, so I have
                        time to spend on all the work you're funding me to do. But, of course, you'd like to see some
                        results before you dump a bunch of money into my pocket. That's reasonable.
                    <p>
                        Hopefully my current resume and existing work history, even if established through more
                        traditional means, gives you some feel for my skill and abilities. I'm also working on a few
                        ideas to provide as much transparency as possible and maybe even offer some incentives for
                        higher contribution levels. It's still early stages, but here are some of the ideas I've been
                        thinking about:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Regular, public stand-ups</strong> - in the style of Agile Scrum. A friend
                                suggested IRC, but I'm also considering an audio recording; kind of a mini-podcast.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>A donation level that allows voting</strong> on what I will work on. This (and
                                the next idea) would likely be done through Patreon.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>A donation level that can request projects/bugs/features</strong> for me to work
                                on.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        I&apos;m also open to hearing your ideas. While I do expect to also be doing freelance
                        work-for-hire,
                        I&apos;d like to keep these funding efforts in the realm of Open Source so everybody can benefit.
                    <p>
                        And, of course, you're always free to withdraw your support. Both of the patron-based services
                        I've chosen allow you to cancel your recurring payment at any time. I hope that as we travel
                        down this road together I don't give you reason to do so, but I also understand that it's
                        <strong>your</strong> money and you can do whatever you want with it. With any luck we can
                        use it make the world a better place :-)
