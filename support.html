                        Patrons provide regular, recurring funding so that I can focus on doing the work that I love
                        instead of spending that time hunting through job boards, polishing my resume and sitting in
                        interviews. At the moment, I have accounts with two crowd-sourcing services that support the
                        patron model:

                                The plan I've chosen on <strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a></strong>
                                pays out pledges <strong>monthly</strong>. Patreon's system also lets <em>creators</em>
                                specify pledge levels that unlock bonus material, access, etc.. For more information,
                                see my profile.

                        <em>Bounties</em> are rewards or incentives that the an individual or organization offers in
                        return for a bug being fixed or feature implemented. Typically, bounties are paid up front with
                        the funds being held by the service (see below) until the bounty is claimed.

                                is a site that allows bounties to be placed and claimed on Github issues. Google Wallet
                                &amp; PayPal only for now. Bounties remain until the issue is closed. If the issue is
                                closed as "won't fix" the bounty amount is refunded. Bountysource also supports
                                fundraising.
