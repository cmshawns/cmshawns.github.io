                <p>
                    Many years ago a small business owner explained to me that the reason their company provided web
                    hosting services, ran a gaming auction site AND hired out programmers for contract work was to
                    provide a safety net. If the bottom fell out of any of those businesses the other two could keep
                    the company afloat until they found something to replace it. I remember thinking that made perfect
                    sense, but didn't think much more about it at the time. That was just before the (first) Dot-com
                    bubble burst. I managed to hang on through a couple more employers, but those were scary times.
                    When all your eggs are in one basket - all your income coming from one employer - losing it can be
                    devastating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern, personal technology has brought us to a brave new era of possibilities for the independent
                    creator. Long- and short-form videos are no longer the sole purview of major corporations. Podcasts
                    have all but completely replaced talk radio. More and more authors are self-publishing every day.
                    And now, with the growing popularity of <em>crowd-funding</em> and the ability to crowd-source for
                    any number of needs, the average individual finally has all the pieces. I think back to that company,
                    with their diversified stable of services (yes, they're still around), and I ask myself "why can't
                    we all do that?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been programming professionally for over 20 years, in a number of different languages - from
                    QuickBASIC to C/C++ to Perl, PHP to Javascript to C#. I create software because I am a modern
                    craftsman. Creating something that is stable and solid and useful is my passion. Often businesses
                    have other priorities and other ideals. In the world we inherited from the Industrial Revolution
                    individual workers had to bow to that pressure, but today I believe we have other options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, this page represents the first, fledgling steps in my grand experiment - something I've been
                    thinking about for quite awhile. My goal is to establish a variety of income streams: Using
                    crowd-funding, work-for-hire, selling products, writing and anything else I can think of that I
                    enjoy doing and find worthwhile. Enough that, taken all together, they could replace working for
                    a single employer. I know this isn't going to happen overnight. It's going to take time, and I'm
                    going to need to prove that I'm worth investing in - not to make some business owners rich, but to
                    make the world a better place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, you will join me.

                        <em>Bounties</em> are rewards or incentives that an individual or organization offers in
                        return for a bug being fixed or feature implemented. Typically, bounties are paid up front with
                        the funds being held by the service (see below) until the bounty is claimed.
