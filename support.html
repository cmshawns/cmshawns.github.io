                        Patrons provide regular, recurring funding so that I can focus on doing the work that I love
                        instead of spending that time hunting through job boards, polishing my resume and sitting in
                        interviews. At the moment, I have accounts with two crowd-sourcing services that support the
                        patron model:

                                The plan I've chosen on <strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a></strong>
                                pays out pledges <strong>monthly</strong>. Patreon's system also lets <em>creators</em>
                                specify pledge levels that unlock bonus material, access, etc.. For more information,
